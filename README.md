Current state of my Circuit Playgraound Express board and possibly other things.

# Current sate
Currently there is CircuitPython code that tries to enable multiple functionality of CPX. Due to `MemoryError`s and unability to gracefully handle those, there is also some beginners Arduino code w/ Adafruit Circuit Playground header incorporated to enable CPX-specific functions (neopixels, sensors, etc.)
